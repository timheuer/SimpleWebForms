# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves upgrading a legacy ASP.NET WebForms application from .NET Framework 4.6 to .NET 9, while migrating the user interface from WebForms to Blazor Server. The application currently consists of three main pages (Home, About, Contact) with basic navigation, Bootstrap styling, and a simple greeting form with server-side state management. The upgrade will modernize the technology stack while preserving all existing functionality and improving maintainability, performance, and development experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade the application from .NET Framework 4.6 to .NET 9, so that I can leverage modern .NET features, improved performance, and long-term support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is migrated THEN the system SHALL target .NET 9 framework
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality without regression
3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL use modern .NET 9 compatible packages
4. WHEN the project structure is updated THEN the system SHALL follow modern .NET project conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from WebForms to Blazor Server, so that I can use modern component-based architecture and improve code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebForms pages are migrated THEN the system SHALL convert them to equivalent Blazor components
2. WHEN server-side functionality is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing business logic
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide the same user experience as the original WebForms application
4. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL follow Blazor best practices and conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the same navigation experience, so that I can access Home, About, and Contact pages as before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the application THEN the system SHALL display a navigation menu with Home, About, and Contact links
2. WHEN I click on navigation links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding pages
3. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent layout and styling
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL default to the Home page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the greeting functionality to work exactly as before, so that I can enter my name and receive a personalized greeting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a name in the text box and click "Greet Me" THEN the system SHALL display "hello [name]"
2. WHEN I click "Greet Me" without entering a name THEN the system SHALL display "Please enter a name."
3. WHEN I enter HTML markup in the name field THEN the system SHALL properly encode it to prevent XSS attacks
4. WHEN I interact with the greeting form THEN the system SHALL maintain state during the session
5. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL preserve the entered name value in the text box

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain the same visual appearance and responsive design, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display the same Bootstrap-based styling as the original
2. WHEN I view the application on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive behavior
3. WHEN I view the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL display the same dark theme and layout
4. WHEN I view page content THEN the system SHALL maintain the same typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy
5. WHEN I interact with buttons and form elements THEN the system SHALL maintain the same Bootstrap styling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose issues and maintain application stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information
2. WHEN an unhandled exception occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error page
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize logging configuration
4. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL include sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow modern .NET 9 and Blazor conventions, so that it's maintainable and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN the system SHALL follow standard .NET 9 web application organization
2. WHEN Blazor components are created THEN the system SHALL separate markup, code, and styling appropriately
3. WHEN services are configured THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection patterns
4. WHEN the application is configured THEN the system SHALL use modern configuration patterns and appsettings.json
5. WHEN static files are served THEN the system SHALL use modern static file handling

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain development productivity, so that I can continue to build and debug the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I build the application THEN the system SHALL compile without errors or warnings
2. WHEN I run the application in development mode THEN the system SHALL support hot reload for rapid development
3. WHEN I debug the application THEN the system SHALL provide full debugging capabilities
4. WHEN I make changes to components THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately during development
